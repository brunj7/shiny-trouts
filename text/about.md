## Welcome to the LTER Animal Data Explorer!

#### Why did we build this app?

This shiny app was built, in part, to provide users a way of exploring morphological characteristics of the different animal species found within NSF's [Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)](https://lternet.edu/) sites using the [`lterdatasampler`](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/) R package.
